A coding quiz to test your knowledge and showcase my skills! Score is calculated by the amount of time left on the clock - five seconds are deducted for each incorrect response.

## Topics Learned
* Deeper dive into event listeners
* DOM manipulation through raw JavaScript
* Adding persistence through local storage 

Note/Caveat: I didn't dynamically create all of the major elements of the application. There is still a basic structure in place in the HTML which served as a backbone of the styling. Some of the elements may have been repurposed in ways not as they were originally intended - but it works!!! Call it a novice attempt at DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself" through the CSS selectors.   

## Final thoughts
The instructor warned us that this assignment tends to be a heavy lift for students. It has a lot of parts and not starter code. While I did spend several hours completing it, I felt more confident than ever in my ability to plan and execute this assignment. As I've said before, I believed I had a leg up having programmed (mostly in Python) before, but I am realy happy with my progress so far. It is starting to click and that is a great feeling, especially since I am pushing to learn on my own as much as possible without the help of tutors.
